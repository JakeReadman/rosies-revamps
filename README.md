#rosies-revamps

A simple website for a friend mainly using plain CSS with a small amount of JQuery for the navbar responsiveness on scroll.

Also utilises Bootstrap 4 for the Navbar.

Media responsiveness in place for tablets and mobile where the sections stack instead of in-line.

Currently still under construction, this is just a holding page for now while I wait on more imagery and content to build the full website, including a gallery page, a blog and a testimonials page.
